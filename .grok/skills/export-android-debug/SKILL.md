description: |-
  Publish a debug-signed Android APK via the Android debug GitHub Action and a
  GitHub Release under android-debug/<sha>. Never export locally unless the
  user explicitly asks for a local build. Use when the user wants an Android
  debug APK, debug build, or a downloadable APK on GitHub.

  Examples:
    - user: "Create me an android debug build" → PR into android-debug, wait, give APK URL
    - user: "I need a debug APK on GitHub" → same path; report the release download link
    - user: "Export the Android APK locally" → only then consider a local export; otherwise Actions

Read that file and its `references/` as needed, then run the workflow there. Do not invent a parallel process.
